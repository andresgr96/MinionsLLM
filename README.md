# MinionsLLM
Minions LLM is a Task-adaptive Framework for the Control of Multi-Agent Systems Through Natural Language by integrating Large Language Models with Behavior Trees and
Formal Grammars to enable the training and control of multi-agent systems within arbitrary, user-defined environments. 

## Disclaimer
This framework was built for the research for my masters thesis at VU Amsterdam, supervised by Dr. Eliseo Ferrante.
For a full explanation of the framework and experimental results, feel free to read the paper:

## Introduction

![MinionsLLM Framework Flow](examples/framework_flow.png)

MinionsLLM provides standardized interfaces for defining environments, agents, and behavioral primitives, and introduces a novel formal grammar based methodology for syntetic dataset generation to fine-tune LLMs for improved syntactic validity and task performance. Main packages:

‚Äì **LLM Interface**: This Package provides functionality to prompt LLMs locally using different backend options in order to get behavior trees.

‚Äì **Agent Control**: Provides functionality for the control of agents in a simulated environment through behavior trees.

‚Äì **Tree Parser**: Acting as middleware between the Interface and Control packages, it provides functionality to parse trees into executable commands for the agents.

‚Äì **Dataset Grammar**: Provides functionality to generate custom datasets through different methods.

## Usage

MinionsLLM provides several example scripts to help you get started with different aspects of the framework:

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to MinionsLLM! To ensure code quality and consistency, please follow these guidelines:

### üç¥ 1. Fork and Branch

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MinionsLLM.git
   cd MinionsLLM
   ```
3. **Create a new branch** from the `development` branch (not `main`):
   ```bash
   git switch development
   git switch -c your-branch-name
   ```

### üîß 2. Code Quality Standards

Before submitting your changes, ensure they meet our code quality standards:

#### Install Code Quality Tools
```bash
# Install code quality requirements
pip install -r code_tools/requirements.txt
```

#### Check and Fix Code Quality
We provide automated scripts to check and fix common issues:

```bash
# Check for all code quality issues
./code_tools/fix_all.sh
```

#### Code Standards We Enforce
- **Black**: Consistent code formatting
- **isort**: Organized import statements
- **MyPy**: Type hints and static type checking
- **Darglint**: Docstring parameter documentation
- **Pydocstyle**: Docstring style compliance
- **Pyflakes**: Unused imports and variables detection

### üìù 3. Submit Your Changes

1. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: clear description of what you added"
   ```

2. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

3. **Open a Pull Request** into the `development` branch (NOT `main`)

### ü§ñ Automated Quality Checks

When you open a pull request, our GitHub Actions will automatically:
- Run all code quality tools
- Check for formatting issues
- Validate type hints
- Ensure docstring compliance
- Run tests

**Your PR must pass all automated checks before it can be merged.** If any checks fail, you'll see the specific errors and can fix them by pushing additional commits to your branch.

### üåü Branch Strategy

- **`main`**: Production-ready code, stable releases
- **`development`**: Integration branch for new features
- **Feature branches**: Individual contributions (branch from `development`)

All contributions should target the `development` branch, which is periodically merged into `main` after thorough testing.
